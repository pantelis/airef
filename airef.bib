  abstract      = "We introduce the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model, which
                   aims at becoming the white-box version of Deep Neural
                   Networks (DNN). The DSN model provides a simple, universal
                   yet powerful structure, similar to DNN, to represent any
                   knowledge of the world, which is transparent to humans. The
                   conjecture behind the DSN model is that any type of real
                   world objects sharing enough common features are mapped into
                   human brains as a symbol. Those symbols are connected by
                   links, representing the composition, correlation, causality,
                   or other relationships between them, forming a deep,
                   hierarchical symbolic network structure. Powered by such a
                   structure, the DSN model is expected to learn like humans,
                   because of its unique characteristics. First, it is
                   universal, using the same structure to store any knowledge.
                   Second, it can learn symbols from the world and construct
                   the deep symbolic networks automatically, by utilizing the
                   fact that real world objects have been naturally separated
                   by singularities. Third, it is symbolic, with the capacity
                   of performing causal deduction and generalization. Fourth,
                   the symbols and the links between them are transparent to
                   us, and thus we will know what it has learned or not - which
                   is the key for the security of an AI system. Fifth, its
                   transparency enables it to learn with relatively small data.
                   Sixth, its knowledge can be accumulated. Last but not least,
                   it is more friendly to unsupervised learning than DNN. We
                   present the details of the model, the algorithm powering its
                   automatic learning ability, and describe its usefulness in
                   different use cases. The purpose of this paper is to
                   generate broad interest to develop it within an open source
                   project centered on the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model

  abstract      = "In multi-label classification, the main focus has been to
                   develop ways of learning the underlying dependencies between
                   labels, and to take advantage of this at classification
                   time. Developing better feature-space representations has
                   been predominantly employed to reduce complexity, e.g., by
                   eliminating non-helpful feature attributes from the input
                   space prior to (or during) training. This is an important
                   task, since many multi-label methods typically create many
                   different copies or views of the same input data as they
                   transform it, and considerable memory can be saved by taking
                   advantage of redundancy. In this paper, we show that a
                   proper development of the feature space can make labels less
                   interdependent and easier to model and predict at inference

                   restricted Boltzmann machines. We present a deep network

  abstract      = "Despite significant recent advances in the field of face
                   recognition, implementing face verification and recognition
                   efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current
                   approaches. In this paper we present a system, called
                   FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to
                   a compact Euclidean space where distances directly
                   correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space
                   has been produced, tasks such as face recognition,
                   verification and clustering can be easily implemented using
                   standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature
                   vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network
                   trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather
                   than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep
                   learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly
                   aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using
                   a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our
                   approach is much greater representational efficiency: we
                   achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using
                   only 128-bytes per face. On the widely used Labeled Faces in
                   the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record
                   accuracy of 99.63\%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves
                   95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the
                   best published result by 30\% on both datasets. We also
                   introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic
                   triplet loss, which describe different versions of face
                   embeddings (produced by different networks) that are

                   facial landmarks and textures from features extracted from a
                   facial-recognition network. Unlike previous approaches, our
                   encoding feature vector is largely invariant to lighting,

                   Q-learning, drawing experience from a replay buffer. This is
                   motivated by making a connection between the fixed points of

                   This connection allows us to estimate the Q-values from the

                   Q-learning updates. We refer to the new technique as 'PGQL',

              their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning
              successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity,
              however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must
              derive efficient representations of the environment from
              high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past
              experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other
              animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious
              combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory
              processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural

              emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference

              agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains,

              which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with
              fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent
              advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel
              artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn
              successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs

              the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We
              demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the

              performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level

              set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture

              high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the

              aiming to strike an appropriate balance of breadth
              \{\textbackslashem and depth\} that will enable someone having
              taken first graduate courses in matrix algebra and probability to
              get started doing research and/or developing tensor algorithms
              and software. Some background in applied optimization is useful
              but not strictly required. The material covered includes tensor
              rank and rank decomposition; basic tensor factorization models
              and their relationships and properties (including fairly good
              coverage of identifiability); broad coverage of algorithms
              ranging from alternating optimization to stochastic gradient;
              statistical performance analysis; and applications ranging from
              source separation to collaborative filtering, mixture and topic
              modeling, classification, and multilinear subspace learning.",

                   communications systems that aim to improve on and to even
                   replace the vast expert knowledge in the field of
                   communications using modern machine learning techniques.
                   These have recently achieved breakthroughs in many different
                   domains, but not yet in communications. By interpreting a
                   communications system as an autoencoder, we develop a
                   fundamental new way to think about radio communications
                   system design as an end-to-end reconstruction optimization
                   task that seeks to jointly optimize transmitter and receiver
                   components in a single process. We further present the
                   concept of Radio Transformer Networks (RTNs) as a means to
                   incorporate expert domain knowledge in the ML model and

                   of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an
                   agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions
                   simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks
                   share a common representation that, like unsupervised
                   learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic
                   rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing
                   this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning
                   can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual
                   task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous
                   state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\% expert human
